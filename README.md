# Fun with Lit and Webpack


> I don't want to feel caged by framework-specifric knowledge. Evan You and like are developing their frameworks with the underlying guts of JavaScript, the low-level. And I'd like to at least understand as close to that as I can whilst using their undeniably useful and briiiant frameworks.

## Goals of the project
- Create Web Components which are agnostic of frameworks
- Create something ridiculously lean and fast
- Hopefully create something fellow devs find useful, even just the reading maybe :smile: :100:
- Develop my personal prowess with webpack further
